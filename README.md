Everything Ever for my [Minecraft / Hytale / Other Game?] Modding journey

## About
Howdy! My name is Earth, and I'm new to coding in general. To effectively learn java coding and be prepared for what I eventually want to do (Minecraft modding!), I will be using this repository to document my progress. I am 22 (as of 2/9/2026) and while I've attempted coding before, I've never been able to catch on to it, so I'm hoping this time will be it. I am an animal science major, so this is just a hobby of mine rather than a career opportunity, though I welcome the career advancements as well. Lets hope this doesn't turn upside down on me.

### Why Learn?
I want to become a vector for people to be connected to nature in a way that fits our modern lives. A lot of people in more industrialized countries will not know about nature and ecology in any amount of depth because they aren't exposed to it, or they don't need to know it to live. I am hopeful that I can eventually create something that can become educational but fun to others. Since a major part of animal science is how they are used agriculturally, I want to share the knowledge I gain in a way that will hopefully be fun for others. Even just a short summer internship and a few college courses have shown me how much the public does not know about animals, nature, and how we as humans have shaped the world's ecosystems. According to the USDA's farm census, farm and ranch families comprise less than 2% of the U.S. population, but EVERYONE needs farmers and ranchers to live. Whats worse, the average age of producers is 47. 47! So I can only do this in the hope that I **might** get someone interested. And if I dont? Well at least I had fun with it.
