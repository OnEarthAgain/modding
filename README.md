Everything Ever for my [Minecraft / Hytale / Other Game?] Modding journey

## About
Howdy! My name is Earth, and I'm new to coding in general. To effectively learn java coding and be prepared for what I eventually want to do (Minecraft modding!), I will be using this repository to document my progress. I am 22 (as of 2/9/2026) and while I've attempted coding before, I've never been able to catch on to it, so I'm hoping this time will be it. I am an animal science major, so this is just a hobby of mine rather than a career opportunity, though I welcome the career advancements as well. Lets hope this doesn't turn upside down on me.

### First session
2/9/2026 - Learning Java Basics. W3Schools my beloved.
